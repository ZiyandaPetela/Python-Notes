# Python-week-1
* today was my first day since I was at the hospital the last two days. I learnt new things like installing all the necessary apps for my coding environment like python, jupiter and the text editor visual studio codde, I also created github.
* I also learnt introduction to python,why python is important and syntax that python uses which is different from other different languages.
* python variables, how to declare the variables and assign variables to them
* why comments are important and how to use them.
* the differre between global and local variables.
* Different python data types that are available like float,int string, boolean etc
* Data structures that we have lists and how is it different from tuples and dictionery's
* list
      * List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members
      * List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
      *List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc
      *To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function
      *lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list'
  *Tuples
     *tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
     *is ordered and unchangeable.
     * are written with round brackets.
     *Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
*Dictionery's
   *Dictionary is a collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
   * items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

* different opearators that we have got such as arithmetic,logic,string ,comparison etc.
* python divides the operations the following groups:
  * arithmetic * / + %
  * assignment = += -= 
  * comparison == < > <= >= !=
  * logical and or not
  * identity is  is not
  *the order of operator precedence describes the order which operations are performed.
    ()	Parentheses	
    **	Exponentiation	
    +x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
    *  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus
   
    *  Control flow
    *  conditions can be used commonly are "if statements" and loops.
    * "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
    * I learnt that python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
    * for example
    * use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is 
       greater than a"
    * Elif
      *The elif keyword is if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition
    *  Else
     * The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
     * python has two primitive loop commands:
       *while loops
       *for loops
       
    *while loop
       * With the while loop  can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
       *to increment index, or else the loop will continue forever.
       *With the break statement  can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
       *With the continue statement can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next
* for loop
     * for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
     * does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand
     * To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, can use the range() function,
     * The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.


* functions
* can be defined using the "def" keyword followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses
* can take one or more arguments, and they may or may not return a value
* arguments must be the same number as
